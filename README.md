# DSA-with-Js

Contains DS and algo in javascript #365daysofcode

## What am I expecting from this #360daysOfCode?

No amount of technology is going to fix bad design for you. You can learn any framework or language and still end up with coupled codebase. There is no shortcut to good design, So goal for this year is to not just do question over leetcode,hackerrank, but to master fundamentals like abstraction, coupling, cohesion, modularity,SOLID, design patterns etc, I maintain all my learning in personal workspace in [NOTION](https://www.notion.so)

## Mistakes to not commit while doing #360DaysOfCode challenge

- Not creating enough small tasks
- Focusing on learning one topic at a time
- Tracking the number of hours spent coding
